#San Diego Brewery Explorer

The San Diego Brewery Explorer allows you to visualize, search for, add new, and plan trips to San Diego County Breweries. You can plan your trip based on location, if they serve food, and if they are dog friendly. Search for the UserCredentials in main.qml component and add in your AGOL credentials. This uses AGOL credits (.04 per route) to generate the route.
