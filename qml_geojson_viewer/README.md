#QML GeoJSON Viewer

GeoJSON is one of the most commonly used spatial data formats, and the spec is open and easy to follow. GeoJSON features can easily be converted to Esri features and displayed on a map. This example shows how to read a local GeoJSON file and also how to request GeoJSON features be returned from an AGOL hosted feature service using the REST API.
